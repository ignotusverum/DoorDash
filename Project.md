# ios-takehome-project

Take-home project for prospective iOS devs!


Background
--------------------------
At DoorDash, we allow customers to order delivery from their favorite local restaurants. For this exercise, you will be building a ‘lite’ version of DoorDash. Users will be able to pick a location on a Map, view a list of nearby stores, view basic store details, and add stores to a list of ‘Favorites’.

We expect this project to take between 2-4 hours.

Requirements
--------------------------
1. Users can select a location by dragging a Map
2. Users can browse a list of stores available to the location selected previously
3. Users can drill down into store details by tapping on a store cell. Here they can view the store logo, available menu categories, and add the store as a ‘Favorite’. Favorites should persist across app launches (i.e., you cannot simply store a list of favorites in memory).
4. Users can browse their ‘Favorite’ stores in a separate tab

_*Note that the spec includes a search icon in the store list page -- you can ignore this functionality for now_ 


Design
--------------------------
Find the design spec located in teh _DesignSpec_ directory in this repo. You should try to implement to spec! This means colors, assets, layout, etc.


Other Notes
--------------------------
As much as reasonable, you ought to treat this project like it is a production app. Modularize your code, test when appropriate, comment if necessary, etc.

Also feel free to pull in libraries (AFNetworking, FLKAutoLayout, etc) as you see fit. For dependency management, please use cocoapods or carthage.

When You're Done
--------------------------
Zip up the entire project directory and send it back. Thanks for your hard work!
